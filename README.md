# Ray Tracing Mie Scattering by Nanoparticles

## Overview

A computational study on Mie scattering in nanoparticles using a custom-built Java ray tracing engine. The engine simulates and visualizes the interaction of light with nanoparticles, applying principles of electromagnetic wave scattering and geometric optics.

## Features

- **Mie Scattering Calculations**: Computes size parameters, Bessel functions, Mie coefficients, and efficiencies.
- **Ray Tracing**: Simulates light interactions with nanoparticles and renders visualizations.
- **Visualization Enhancement**: The visualization of the scattering effects is enhanced by making use of an atmospheric effect.

## You'll need

- Java (11+) JDK
- Maven
- Apache Commons Math library
